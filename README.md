# Cropybara - Webtoon Stitcher & Cropper
Cropybara is a browser-based application designed to help users stitch multiple images into a single vertical strip (like a webtoon/manhwa panel) and then intelligently crop it into smaller, manageable slices. It's built with SvelteKit and leverages modern web APIs for a smooth, client-side experience.

## Workflow
1. Start by uploading your images using one of the many available methods.
2. Set your project name, desired slice height, and choose/configure the cut detection method. Cropybara will analyze your images and suggest initial cut points if an automatic detector is chosen.
3. Review the proposed cuts. Add, remove, or fine-tune their positions in the interactive editor.
4. Once satisfied, Cropybara will process the images and provide a ZIP file containing the final slices.
